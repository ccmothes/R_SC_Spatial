## La Jamais Contente


![Land Speed Record 1899 - 100km/h](D:\R_SC_Spatial\images\Jamais_contente.jpg)


2020 land speed record is 1,220 km/h 

## Rate of Change

```{r, echo = TRUE}
rOC <- (1220 - 100) / (1997 - 1899)
# linear change per year
rOC
```

## the growth of tech 

```{r echo = TRUE}
# initial state 
x <- 100 
# speed of light in kilometers per hour 
sol <- 1079000000 

n = 1 
while(x < sol){
  x <- x*2
  n = n+1
}
# Speed in km/h
print(x) 
```

## Years to the speed of light 

```{r  echo = TRUE}
### number of iterations(years) required 
print(n)
# if double occurs every year,
# in what year would the car break the speed of light 
1899+n
```

## Rate of processing power 
```{r out.width="700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/R_SC_Spatial/images/moorsLaw.png")
```

## Software is what makes it impactful 

**Learning to code** <- "Develop understanding of" 

**Computer excel at** 

- precision and reproducibility 
- for loops 
- functions 

**Those who use them**

- build for function(not perfection) and expect change
- quality comes from iterations 
- how processes scale 

## Why Learn to Code 

In the present  

- **It will help you with your current needs** 

In the future 

- **It will help you understand what's running in the background of our world**

Let's do it.
